# Layout Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Content Cut-off Issue**
   - Reduced excessive padding and margins throughout
   - Removed min-h-screen constraints that pushed content down
   - Made all text and elements more compact

2. **Play Page Improvements**
   - Smaller heading sizes (3xl → 5xl instead of 4xl → 6xl)
   - Reduced button size and padding
   - Made game mode cards more compact (2-column grid on mobile)
   - Removed "Recent Beefs" section to save space
   - Smaller icons and text in game mode cards

3. **Main Layout Adjustments**
   - Reduced main content padding (py-2 md:py-4 instead of py-6 md:py-8)
   - Removed fixed height constraints
   - Made layout more flexible for content

Now all content should be visible on screen without excessive scrolling!
