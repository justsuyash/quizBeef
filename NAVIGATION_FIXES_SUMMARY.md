# Navigation Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Documents/Library Page Access**
   - Changed authRequired from `true` to `false` so it's accessible without login
   - Library navigation link correctly points to `/documents`

2. **Profile Navigation**
   - Profile link now redirects to `/login` when user is not logged in
   - When logged in, it goes to `/user/{userId}`

3. **Additional Navigation Links (Desktop)**
   - Added "Upload Document" link in desktop sidebar
   - Added "Dashboard" link in desktop sidebar
   - Settings link remains available

## Page Routes Available:
- `/` - Play page (Home)
- `/documents` - Library/Documents page
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard (requires login)
- `/upload` - Upload documents (requires login)
- `/leaderboard` - Leaderboards
- `/login` - Login page
- `/settings` - Settings

## To Access Protected Pages:
You need to log in first. The pages that require authentication:
- Dashboard
- Upload
- Quiz pages
- User profile

Navigate to `/login` to sign in or create an account.
