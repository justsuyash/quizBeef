## V1.7 Summary (UI polish + Admin Seeder)

### UI
- Play page cleanup: centered container (max-w-7xl), improved spacing, refined gradient tiles with rounded corners, softer borders/shadows, adjusted Play button sizing.
- Stats pill: numbers moved inside bubbles; widened ELO bubble; profile avatar pill made largest; subtle glass/blur container.
- Admin header: added current-user avatar pill.

### Admin & Seeding
- Integrated advanced seeder directly into Admin action (`seedDatabase`):
  - Seeds users with avatarUrl (Pravatar/DiceBear), folders, documents, questions/answers.
  - Generates 90 days of quiz histories, awards achievements, updates user stats.
  - Seeds Elo history time series; marks top performers.
- `main.wasp`: added `EloHistory` to `seedDatabase` entities.
- Backfill action ensures current user has an `avatarUrl` if missing.

### Fixes
- TypeScript: corrected `faker.helpers.maybe` signature and Difficulty enum selection casting.
- Minor style/spacing tweaks across pages.
